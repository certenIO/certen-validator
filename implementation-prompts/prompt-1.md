Task: Now that we have implemented. This is a standalone independent certen validator node able to be cloned in or built to run a validator mode on the certen network, you need to go back and exhaustively ensure that your entire first implementation plan was 100% implemented. The plan document is here: "C:\Accumulate_Stuff\certen\independant_validator\implementation-planning-doc\IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md"
Second, using go tidy and build you need to actually build this certen vadlaidotr node and get it up operating and a healthy status. Obviously it won’t yet be connected to the certain test network, but it should be looking for the test network to connect and join.
